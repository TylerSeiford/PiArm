# PiArm
Main program and detecting utility for my Raspberry Pi based robotic arm project.
Can be easily adapted to other gamepads with the detection program.

## Hardware
This project used a Raspberry Pi 2 for controlling a servo arm with a USB gamepad.  It used a Logitech F310 as the USB gamepad, but any USB device could easily be adapted to the project.
